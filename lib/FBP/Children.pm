=head2 find_first

  my $dialog = $object->find_first(
      isa  => 'FBP::Dialog',
      name => 'MyDialog1',
  );

The C<find_first> method implements a generic depth-first search of the object
model. It takes a series of condition pairs that are used in the provided order
(allowing the caller to tune the way in which the filter is done).

Each pair is treated as a method + value set. First, the object is checked to
ensure it has that method, and then the method output is string-matched to the
output of the method via C<$object-E<gt>$method() eq $value>.

The special condition "isa" is applied as C<$object-E<gt>isa($value)> instead.

Returns the first object located that matches the provided criteria,
or C<undef> if nothing in the object model matches the conditions.
