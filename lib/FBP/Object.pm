# 
# The full wxFormBuilder XML data structure will contain a far larger breadth
# of properties than are actually supported in the L<FBP> object model.
# 
# In other cases, the object model may normalise a property that some specific
# consumer will wish to access in the original form.
# 
# The C<raw> method provides access to a C<HASH> containing the keys and values
# of the C<property> tags in the original XML document.

=head2 permission

The C<permission> flag, present on the vast majority of wxFormBuilder objects,
influences the code structure used to create and store any resulting Perl
GUI objects.

This property is normally used to control attribute privacy under C++, but is
repurposed for usage in Perl code generators such as L<FBP::Perl>.

=cut

has permission => (
	is       => 'ro',
	isa      => 'Str',
	required => 1,
	default  => 'none',
);
