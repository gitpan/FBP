=head2 raw

The full wxFormBuilder XML data structure will contain a far larger breadth
of properties than are actually supported in the L<FBP> object model.

In other cases, the object model may normalise a property that some specific
consumer will wish to access in the original form.

The C<raw> method provides access to a C<HASH> containing the keys and values
of the C<property> tags in the original XML document.
