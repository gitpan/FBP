NAME
    FBP - Parser and Object Model for wxFormBuilder Project Files (.fpb
    files)

SYNOPSIS
      my $object = FBP->new;
      
  $object->parse_file( 'MyProject.fbp' );

DESCRIPTION
    NOTE: Documentation is limited as this module is in active development

    wxFormBuilder is currently the best and most sophisticated program for
    designing wxWidgets dialogs, and generating the code for these designs.

    However, wxFormBuilder does not currently support the generation of Perl
    code. If we are to produce Perl code for the designs it creates, the
    code generation must be done independantly, outside of wxFormBuilder
    itself.

    FBP is a SAX-based parser and object model for the XML project files
    that are created by wxFormBuilder. While it does NOT do the creation of
    Perl code itself, it should serve as a solid base for anyone who wishes
    to produce a code generator for these saved files.

METHODS
  new
      my $fbp = PBP->new;

    The "new" constructor takes no arguments and creates a new parser/model
    object.

  dialog
      my $dialog = $fbp->dialog('MyDialog1');

    Convience method which finds and returns the root FBP::Dialog object for
    a specific named dialog box in the object model.

      my $ok = $fbp->parse_file( 'foo/bar.fbp' );

    The "parse_file" method takes a named fbp project file, and parses it to
    produce an object model.

    Returns true if the parsing run succeeds, or throws an exception on
    error.
