NAME
    FBP - Parser and Object Model for wxFormBuilder Project Files (.fpb
    files)

SYNOPSIS
      my $object = FBP->new;
      
  $object->parse_file( 'MyProject.fbp' );

DESCRIPTION
    wxFormBuilder is currently the best and most sophisticated program for
    designing wxWidgets dialogs and generating code from these designs.

    However wxFormBuilder does not currently support the generation of Perl
    code. And so if we are to produce Perl code for the designs it creates,
    the code generation must be done independantly.

    FBP is a SAX-based parser and object model for the XML project files
    that are saved by wxFormBuilder. While it does itself the creation of
    generated Perl code, it should serve as a common base for anyone who
    wishes to produce a code generator for these files.

    NOTE: Documentation is limited as this module is in active development

METHODS
  new
      my $fbp = PBP->new;

    The "new" constructor takes no arguments and creates a new parser/model
    object.

  dialog
      my $dialog = $fbp->dialog('MyDialog1');

    Convience method which finds and returns the root FBP::Dialog object for
    a specific named dialog box in the object model.

      my $ok = $fbp->parse_file( 'foo/bar.fbp' );

    The "parse_file" method takes a named fbp project file, and parses it to
    produce an object model.

    Returns true if the parsing run succeeds, or throws an exception on
    error.
